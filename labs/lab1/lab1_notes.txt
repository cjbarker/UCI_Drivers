Using AVRTools to Compile Code
-----------------------------------
1) Open new project AVRCC
2) No new file or folder
3) Map to Simulator -> Atmeg2560
4) Open existing source code
5) Rebuild All
6) To load on board hit connect button, USB
7) Locate lab1.hex file and select "Program" button in FLASH (eprom is for data)
   If all goes well it will be "OK" and leave programming mode
   At this point in time everything is loaded into your board.
   Now, when you load it into your board how does it run what do the lights do.

8) Now change the optimization to None and rebuild.  (See project Configuration options - optimization OO no optimization)
9) Reload program back into board and see what it does, connect to board, program then see what LEDs do.  Let it run for about a minute or so.
   Tell Aaron and the class in the difference between the lights (the differences are in the keyword volitaile)
   WHERE does volitale need to be added to make lab1 work consistently, why is volitale important and why does optimization make a difference.
